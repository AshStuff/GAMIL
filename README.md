This folder contains the code for Miccai 2020 paper "Graph Attention Multi-instance Learning for Accurate Colorectal Cancer Staging" [Miccai 2020](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-59722-1_51)

The code structure is built into 2 stages <br>
1. Stage I where feature encoder is trained
2. Stage II where the graph Attention Multi-instance Learning is trained.
